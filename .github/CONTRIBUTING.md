## üöÄ Quick Project Setup

We use a dockerized environment. Follow these steps to start working with the project:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:wayofdev/laravel-package-tpl.git \
    && cd ./laravel-package-tpl
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   make env
   ```

3. **Install phive and composer dependencies:**

   ```bash
   make phive
   make install
   ```

<br>

## üîß Using the Makefile

This project uses a Makefile to streamline common development tasks. The Makefile includes utilities for managing Docker environments, installing project dependencies, running tests, and linting code.

```bash
make help
```

### ‚Üí Key Commands

* `make env`: Creates a `.env` file from the `.env.example` template.
* `make install`: Installs project composer dependencies
* `make update`: Updates project composer dependencies
* `make up`: Starts all services using Docker Compose.
* `make down`: Stops and removes all services.
* `make logs`: Displays logs for all services.
* `make ssh`: Logs into the running application container for command line operations.
* `make lint`: Executes all linting procedures for YAML, PHP, and Composer files.
* `make commit`: Runs cz-git, a commitizen adapter for commit message formatting in a native environment.

For a full list of commands, run `make help`.

<br>

## üíª Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please feature/fix/update... into individual PRs (not one changing everything)

* **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
* **Create a Branch**: In your fork, create a new branch for your work. Name it appropriately based on the feature, fix, or update you're working on.
* **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes
* **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass by running `make test`.
* **Update Documentation**: If you've made changes that affect the project's documentation, ensure it is updated.
* **Run Linters**: Ensure your code passes all linting checks using `make lint`.
* **Commit Your Changes**: Use the [Conventional Commits](#-commit-message-guidelines) standard for your commit messages. You can use `make commit` to assist in creating commit messages.
* **Push Your Changes**: Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
* **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository. Ensure your PR is focused, addressing a single feature, fix, or improvement.

## üê≥ Docker Support

This package leverages Docker to provide a consistent and isolated development environment. The included [`Makefile`](../Makefile) utilizes `docker-compose.yaml` along with the [wayofdev/docker-php-dev](https://github.com/wayofdev/docker-php-dev) PHP image to streamline setup and usage. This setup facilitates easy configuration of tools like XDebug for debugging and profiling, enhancing the development experience.

To run docker container:

```bash
make up
```

Other commands:

```bash
# Login inside container
$ make ssh

# Turn off containers
$ make down
```

By default, phpunit and phpstan commands will be ran against docker environment.

## üì¶ PHAR Dependencies

We use [Phive](https://phar.io/) to manage PHAR dependencies. You can install all dependencies using the `make phive` command, which will be executed through the Docker environment.

```bash
make phive
```

<br>

## üîç Coding Standards

We enforce coding standards to maintain high code quality and readability. Here's a list of tools we use:

### ‚Üí Composer Normalization

We use [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize) to normalize `composer.json`.

Use:

```bash
make lint-composer
```

### ‚Üí Yaml Lint

We use [`yamllint`](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) to enforce coding standards in YAML files.

To lint yaml files run:

```bash
make lint-yaml
```

by default, [`cytopia/yamllint`](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-yamllint) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### ‚Üí Action Lint

We use [`actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) to enforce coding standards in GitHub Actions workflows.

To lint GitHub Actions run:

```bash
make lint-actions
```

by default, [`rhysd/actionlint`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rhysd/actionlint/tags) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### ‚Üí Markdown Lint

We use [`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/davidanson/markdownlint-cli2) to enforce coding standards in Markdown files.

To lint markdown files run:

```bash
make lint-md-dry
make lint-md
```

### ‚Üí PHP CS Fixer

We use [`friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) together with [`wayofdev/php-cs-fixer-config`](https://github.com/wayofdev/php-cs-fixer-config) to enforce coding standards in PHP files.

Run

```bash
make lint-php
```

to automatically fix coding standard violations.

### ‚Üí Rector

We use [`rector/rector`](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) to refactor and modernize PHP code.

Run

```bash
make refactor
```

to perform code refactoring.

<br>

## üî¨ Dependency Analysis

We use [`maglnet/composer-require-checker`](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker) to prevent the use of unknown symbols in production code.

Run

```bash
make lint-deps
```

to run a dependency analysis.

<br>

## üîí Security Audits

We use Composer's built-in audit feature to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

Run

```bash
make lint-audit
```

<br>

## ü¶† Mutation Tests

We use [`infection/infection`](https://github.com/infection/infection) together with [`roave/infection-static-analysis-plugin`](https://github.com/Roave/infection-static-analysis-plugin) to ensure a minimum quality of the tests. Roave plugin is used to publish mutation score results to the [Stryker Dashboard](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/).

Xdebug support is enabled by default when running commands through the `Makefile`:

```bash
make infect
```

to run mutation tests.

<br>

## üîç Static Code Analysis

We use both [`phpstan/phpstan`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and [`vimeo/psalm`](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) to statically analyze the code.

Run

```bash
make lint-stan
make lint-psalm
```

to run a static code analysis.

We also use the baseline features of [`phpstan/phpstan`](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/baseline) and [`vimeo/psalm`](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/dealing_with_code_issues/#using-a-baseline-file) to ignore existing issues.

Run

```bash
make lint-stan-baseline
make lint-psalm-baseline
```

to regenerate the baselines in:

* [`../phpstan-baseline.neon`](../phpstan-baseline.neon).
* [`../psalm-baseline.xml`](../psalm-baseline.xml).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Ideally, the baseline files should stay empty or shrink over time.

<br>

## üß™ Unit and Functional Tests

We use [`phpunit/phpunit`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) and [`pestphp/pest`](https://github.com/pestphp/pest) to drive the development.

Run to run all the tests:

```bash
# To run both, arch (pest) and unit (phpunit) tests
make test

# To run only arch (pest) tests
make test-arch

# To run only unit (phpunit) tests
make test-unit
```

<br>

## üì¶ Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are an optional but highly recommended way to automate the linting and quality checks before committing changes to the repository. This project provides a predefined configuration that helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### ‚Üí Configured Hooks

Our pre-commit configuration includes several hooks:

* **Trailing Whitespace**: Removes unnecessary trailing spaces.
* **End-of-File Fixer**: Ensures that files end with a newline.
* **Check Added Large Files**: Prevents accidentally adding large files to the git repository, with a current limit set to 600 KB.
* **Commitizen**: Ensures commit messages meet the conventional commit format. This hook is triggered at the commit message stage.
* **PHP-CS-Fixer:** Enforces coding standards in PHP files.
* **Markdown Lint:** Enforces coding standards in Markdown files.

### ‚Üí Installing Pre-commit Hooks

To utilize these hooks, you first need to install them using the command provided by the Makefile:

```bash
make hooks
```
