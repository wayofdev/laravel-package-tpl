## 🛠️ Makefile

This project uses a Makefile to streamline common development tasks. The Makefile includes utilities for managing Docker environments, running tests, and linting code.

```bash
$ make help
```

### → Key Commands

- `make up`: Starts all services using Docker Compose.
- `make down`: Stops all running Docker containers.
- `make ssh`: Logs into the running application container for command line operations.
- `make lint`: Executes all linting procedures for YAML, PHP, and Composer files.
- `make test`: Runs all configured tests using PHPUnit and Pest.
- `make commit`: Runs Commitizen for commit message formatting in a Docker environment.
- `make install`: Installs project dependencies through Composer in a Dockerized environment.

Refer to the output of `make help` for a comprehensive list of available commands.

## 💻 Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please feature/fix/update... into individual PRs (not one changing everything)

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- **Create a Branch**: In your fork, create a new branch for your work. Name it appropriately based on the feature, fix, or update you're working on.
- **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, commit them, and push the branch to your fork.
- **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository. Ensure your PR is focused, addressing a single feature, fix, or improvement.

## 🐳 Docker Support

This package leverages Docker to provide a consistent and isolated development environment. The included [`Makefile`](../Makefile) utilizes `docker-compose.yaml` along with the [wayofdev/docker-php-dev](https://github.com/wayofdev/docker-php-dev) PHP image to streamline setup and usage. This setup facilitates easy configuration of tools like Xdebug for debugging and profiling, enhancing the development experience.

To run docker container:

```bash
$ make up
```

Other commands:

```bash
# Login inside container
$ make ssh

# Turn off containers
$ make down
```

By default, phpunit and phpstan commands will be ran against docker environment.

- [`workflows/integrate.yaml`](workflows/integrate.yaml)
- [`workflows/apply-labels.yml`](workflows/apply-labels.yml)
- [`workflows/create-release.yml`](workflows/create-release.yml)
- [`workflows/shellcheck.yml`](workflows/shellcheck.yml)
- [`workflows/create-arch-diagram.yml`](workflows/create-arch-diagram.yml)

<br>

## 📝 Before You Contribute

- **Tests**: Include tests that cover any new features or bug fixes.
- **Code Quality**: Utilize `make lint` for code style checks and `make lint-stan` for static analysis with [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/).
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes, ensuring other developers can understand and use your contributions effectively.

## 🔍 Coding Standards and Tools

We enforce coding standards to maintain high code quality and readability. Here's a list of tools we use:

### → Composer Normalization

We use [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize) to normalize `composer.json`.

Use:

```bash
$ make lint-composer
```

### → Yaml Lint

We use [`yamllint`](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) to enforce coding standards in YAML files.

(Optional) If you do not have `yamllint` installed yet, run:

```bash
$ brew install yamllint
```

to install `yamllint`.

To lint yaml files run:

```bash
$ make lint-yaml
```

by default, [`cytopia/yamllint`](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-yamllint) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### → PHP CS Fixer

We use [`friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) together with [`wayofdev/php-cs-fixer-config`](https://github.com/wayofdev/php-cs-fixer-config) to enforce coding standards in PHP files.

Run

```bash
$ make lint-php
```

to automatically fix coding standard violations.

<br>

## 🔬 Dependency Analysis

We use [`maglnet/composer-require-checker`](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker) to prevent the use of unknown symbols in production code.

Run

```sh
make lint-deps
```

to run a dependency analysis.

<br>

## 🦠 Mutation Tests

We use [`infection/infection`](https://github.com/infection/infection) to ensure a minimum quality of the tests.

Xdebug support is enabled by default, when running commands through `Makefile`:

```sh
make infect
```

to run mutation tests.

<br>

## ⚙️ Static Code Analysis

We use [`phpstan/phpstan`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) to statically analyze the code.

Run

```sh
make lint-stan
```

to run a static code analysis.

We also use the baseline features of [`phpstan/phpstan`](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/baseline).

Run

```sh
make lint-stan-baseline
```

to regenerate the baselines in [`../phpstan-baseline.neon`](../phpstan-baseline.neon).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Ideally, the baseline file should stay empty or shrink over time.

<br>

## 🧪 Tests

We use [`phpunit/phpunit`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) and [`pestphp/pest`](https://github.com/pestphp/pest) to drive the development.

Run

```sh
make tests
```

to run all the tests.

## 📦 Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are an optional but highly recommended way to automate the linting and quality checks before committing changes to the repository. This project provides a predefined configuration that helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### → Configured Hooks

Our pre-commit configuration includes several hooks:

- **Trailing Whitespace**: Removes unnecessary trailing spaces.
- **End-of-File Fixer**: Ensures that files end with a newline.
- **Check Added Large Files**: Prevents accidentally adding large files to the git repository, with a current limit set to 600 KB.
- **Commitizen**: Ensures commit messages meet the conventional commit format. This hook is triggered at the commit message stage.
- **PHP-CS-Fixer:** Enforces coding standards in PHP files.

### → Installing Pre-commit Hooks

To utilize these hooks, you first need to install them using the command provided by the Makefile:

```bash
$ make hooks
```
